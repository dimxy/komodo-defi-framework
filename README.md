## What is the Komodo DeFi Framework?

The Komodo DeFi Framework is open-source [atomic-swap](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/tutorials/#technical-comparisons) software for seamless, decentralized, peer to peer trading between almost every blockchain asset in existence. This software works with propagation of orderbooks and swap states through the [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) protocol and uses [Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Hashed_Timelock_Contracts) for ensuring that the two parties in a swap either mutually complete a trade, or funds return to thier original owner.

There is no 3rd party intermediary, no proxy tokens, and at all times users remain in sole possession of their private keys.

A [well documented API](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/tutorials/) offers simple access to the underlying services using simple language agnostic JSON structured methods and parameters such that users can communicate with the core in a variety of methods such as [curl](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/api/legacy/buy/) in CLI, or fully functioning [browser, desktop and mobile wallet apps](https://komodoplatform.com/en/downloads/) like [Komodo Wallet](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-wallet).

For a curated list of Komodo DeFi Framework based projects and resources, check out [Awesome KomoDeFi]( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/awesome-komodefi).


## Features

- Perform blockchain transactions without a local native chain (e.g. via Electrum servers)
- Query orderbooks for all pairs within the [supported coins](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins)
- Buy/sell from the orderbook, or create maker orders
- Configure automated ["makerbot" trading](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/swaps_and_orders/start_simple_market_maker_bot/) with periodic price updates and optional [telegram](https://telegram.org/) alerts

## Building from source

### On Host System:

[Pre-built release binaries](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-defi-framework/releases) are available for Android, iOS, OSX, Linux, Windows and WASM.

If you want to build from source, the following prerequisites are required:
- [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- OS specific build tools (e.g. [build-essential](https://linuxhint.com/install-build-essential-ubuntu/) on Linux, [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on OSX or [MSVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=vs-2017) on Win)
- (Optional) OSX: install [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/), e.g. `brew install openssl`.
- (Optional) OSX: run `LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib`
- (Optional) Linux: Install libudev-dev (dpkg) or libudev-devel (rpm) package.
- [Download](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) or [compile](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) `protoc 3.21.x+` and add it to your PATH env. It is also available via package managers depending on the OS.

To build, run `cargo build` (or `cargo build -vv` to get verbose build output).

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/setup/).

### From Container:

If you want to build from source without installing prerequisites to your host system, you can do so by binding the source code inside a container and compiling it there.

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t kdf-build-container -f .docker/Dockerfile .
```

Bind source code into container and compile it:

```sh
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app kdf-build-container cargo build
```

Just like building it on your host system, you will now have the target directory containing the build files.

Alternatively, container images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/komodoofficial/komodo-defi-framework)

## Building WASM binary

Please refer to the [WASM Build Guide](./docs/WASM_BUILD.md).

## Configuration

Basic config is contained in two files, `MM2.json` and `coins`

The user configuration `MM2.json` file contains rpc credentials, your mnemonic seed phrase, a `netid` (8762 is the current main network) and some extra [optional parameters](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/setup/configure-mm2-json/).

For example:
```json
{
  "gui": "core_readme",
  "netid": 8762,
  "rpc_password": "Ent3r_Un1Qu3_Pa$$w0rd",
  "passphrase": "ENTER_UNIQUE_SEED_PHRASE_DONT_USE_THIS_CHANGE_IT_OR_FUNDS_NOT_SAFU",
  "seednodes": ["example-seed-address1.com", "example-seed-address2.com", "example-seed-address3.com", "example-seed-address4.com"]
}
```

The coins file contains information about the coins and tokens you want to trade. A regularly updated version is maintained in the [Komodo Platform coins repository](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins). Pull Requests to add any coins not yet included are welcome.

To facilitate interoperability with the `kdf` service, there is the `adex-cli` command line utility. It provides a questionnaire initialization mode to set up the configuration and obtain the proper coin set through the internet. It can also be used to start or stop the service.

## Usage

To launch the Komodo DeFi Framework, run `./kdf` (or `kdf.exe` in Windows)

To activate a coin:
```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data '{
	"coin": "KMD",
	"method": "electrum",
	"servers": [
		{"url": "electrum1.cipig.net:10001"},
		{"url": "electrum2.cipig.net:10001"},
		{"url": "electrum3.cipig.net:10001"}
	],
	"required_confirmations":10,
	"requires_notarization":true,
	"mm2":1,
	"userpass": "$userpass"
}'
```

To view the orderbook for a pair:
```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data '{
    "userpass":"$userpass",
    "method":"orderbook",
    "base":"KMD",
    "rel":"BTC"
}'
```

To place a buy order:
```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data '{
  "userpass": "$userpass",
  "method": "buy",
  "base": "KMD",
  "rel": "DOGE",
  "volume": "10",
  "price": "4"
}'
```

Refer to the [Komodo Developer Docs](https://komodoplatform.com/en/docs/komodo-defi-framework/api/) for details of additional RPC methods and parameters


## Project structure

[mm2src](mm2src) - Rust code, contains some parts ported from C `as is` (e.g. `lp_ordermatch`) to reach the most essential/error-prone code. Some other modules/crates are reimplemented from scratch.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains the `work in progress` code of the brand-new Komodo DeFi Framework (kdf) built mainly on Rust.  
The current state can be considered as an alpha version.

**<b>WARNING: Use with test coins only or with assets which value does not exceed an amount you are willing to lose. This is alpha stage software! </b>**
