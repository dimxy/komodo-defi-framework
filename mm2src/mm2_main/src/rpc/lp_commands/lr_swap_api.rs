/// The "find_best_quote" RPC implementation to find the best swap with liquidity routing (LR), also known as 'aggregated taker swap with LR'.
/// For the provided list of orderbook entries this RPC will find out the most price-effective swap which may include LR steps.
/// There are LR_0 and LR_1 steps supported meaning liquidity routing before or after the atomic swap.
/// Liquidity routing is supported in the EVM chains. This is actually a token swap performed by an LR provider (currently 1inch).
/// Both tokens must be in the same EVM network.
///
/// Use cases:
/// User is interested in buying some coin. There are orders available with the desired coin but User does not have tokens to fill those orders.
/// User has some amount of a user_rel token and would like to use it for buying the desired coin.
/// User calls this RPC to find the best swap with LR: with user_rel token converted into the atomic swap taker coin with LR_0 step.
/// User may also request to convert received maker coin into user_base token via LR_1 swap.
///
/// Similar logic is for the case when User would like to sell a token and use LR step to convert it into an atomic swap taker coin
/// and/or convert a maker coin into the User desired token.
///
/// User calls this RPC with the following params:
/// * user_base and user_rel tickers,
/// * amount to buy or sell,
/// * list of ask and bid orders list.
///
/// If user_base and/or user_rel differs from the coins in the orders the RPC creates LR_0 and/or LR_1 steps and gets LR provider quotes
/// to obtain prices for LR_0 and LR_1 steps. The RPC alsouses order prices to calculate the most price-effective swap path.
/// As the result the RPC returns params for LR_0 LR_1 and atomic swap corresponding the most price effective aggregated swap.
/// If best swap cannot be found a error is returned.
/// TODO: we should also return total fees.
///
/// More info:
/// The GUI should provide this RPC with a list of ask or bid orders to select best swap path from.
/// Currently for that the "best_orders" RPC can be used:
/// The GUI should pick tokens which resides in the same chains with user_base and/or user_rel and query "best_orders" RPC (maybe multiple times).
/// The "best_orders" results are asks or bids which can be passed into this RPC.
///
/// TODO: develop a more convenient RPC to find ask and bid orders for finding the best swap with LR.
/// It should support getting info about most liquid white-listed tokens from the LR provider, to do search for best swap more efficiently.
